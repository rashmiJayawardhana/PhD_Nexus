        The well-known treatment modalities of cancer include surgery, radiotherapy, and drug therapies 
        (chemotherapy, hormone therapy, targeted therapy, immunotherapy). The type of treatment depends on the 
        cancer diagnosis (type and stage of cancer, organ type, condition of the cells). The principal goal of 
        the treatment is improving the quality of life and/or overall survival.
